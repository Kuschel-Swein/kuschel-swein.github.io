# Skills
Here you can view some skills I sort of own.

## Programming languages

### Java
I learned Java a long time ago, it was the first language I've learned.\
- [Current projects](/projects#java)

### Python
Python is this language you just learn because it's so useful - that's the reason why I learned it.\
- _no current projects_

### Webdevelopment
This is not a real language, it's more like a set of languages like JavaScript (and TypeScript), CSS (and SCSS), HTML (and XML) and maybe PHP.
Of course I know things like JSON too.
I've learned this set of languages because I think websites are awensome, just a click in your bowser and data is sent all over the world.
Thanks to things like electron it's also possible for me to create desktop applications.\
- _no current projects_
